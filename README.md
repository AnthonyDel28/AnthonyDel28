**Hello and welcome to my Github profile üë®**  

### &nbsp;&nbsp; üìå About me
I'm Anthony, a junior web developer. Passionate about development for years, I learned web technologies in order to be able to develop in a full stack way. I develop front end as well as back end, and I have years of experience with Adobe licensing (especially Photoshop). All these skills allow me to be able to develop all the elements of a web application.
